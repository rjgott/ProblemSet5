Problem Set 5 should be turned in on Tuesday, December 6th.

**Information**

We've been playing with the world.sqlite database in class a lot. These questions make use of this database.

    The database is at /blue/bsc4452/share/Class_Files/data/world.sqlite
    It can also be downloaded from: https://github.com/comptoolsres/Class_Files/raw/main/data/world.sqlite

**Question 1 (5 points):**

What is the country with the latest year (most recent) of independence?

    Provide your answer (2 points) and the code used to get that answer (3 points).
    The code can either be SQL or SQLAlchemy code.

**Question 2 (5 points):**

Refer to this page: https://www.statista.com/chart/11430/the-worlds-youngest-countries/

According to this, there are several countries that have become independent since the country in your answer to question 1.

Pick one of those newer countries and using Wikipedia, or another source, add as much data to the country table as you can for that country.

Do not spend a lot of time trying to find all the data. One or two additional items beyond Name and IndepYear is fine.

Provide either a SQL INSERT statement or a SQLAlchemy insert statement to add the data for a new country into the database.

**Question 3 (5 points):**

For the country added in question 2, find 2 cities to add to the cities table of the database and provide the SQL or SQLAlchemy insert statement to add this data.

    Again, don't sweat it if you can't find all of the data.
    If it's not in Wikipedia, don't spend time looking for it!
    A few columns worth of data is sufficient.

**Question 4 (5 points):**

    Grad Students Only; Undergrads get 5 points free, but can earn 5 points extra credit points for doing this question

Using the LifeExpectancy data in the country table on the y-axis, plot this data against some other value.

    Suggestions for the x-axis: GNP, Population or IndepYear could be interesting, but up to you.
    I'd suggest using SQLAlchemy, get the data and make either a dataframe or numpy arrays and then use matplotlib to plot.

**Grad student extra credit (5 points, sorry undergrads, only question 4 counts as extra credit):**

Plot LifeExpectancy vs the ratio of the total population of all the cities in the country divided by the total population of the country. This is an approximation of the % urban population in the country.
